### 1 LSP improvements
- [x] **C# syntax highlighting** both diffview and fileview in our codemirror diff views (I think we have to use the replit one but unsure)
- [x] **C# lsp support** both diffview and fileview in our codemirror diff views (I have an lsp in vscode and it works well but it doesnt seem to use it ?)

### 2 Diff view actual diff
- [x] **Diff view actual diff**: inline, before/after should show what code changed with red/green indication. Make it VERY performant, elegant and readable.
