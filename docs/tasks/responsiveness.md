# tasks
- we have 1000s of projects and repositories. Loading them taks a lof of type and it is really hard to find what I'm looking for and the UI lags.

- we should have a fuzzy search to find the project I'm looking for. 
- we should show the repositories I have cloned locally first.
- we should sort them by last used.
- should be well integrated with the command palette
- I should be able to filter them by projects and have it remember my filter (multi select dropdown with search)
