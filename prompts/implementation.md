Your job is to complete a **single** work item (docs/phases/02_enhanced_workflow.md)

Make sure to study (docs/architecture, docs/goals, docs/ux-design)

Work should be done on separate branches. We can do stacked prs. Work item must be updated once the work is completed for that work item inside the phase-2 document and code must be pushed to the relevant branch.
