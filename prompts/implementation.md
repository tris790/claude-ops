Your job is to orchestrate sub agents to complete phase1 of the project (docs/phases/phase-1/) You should minimize your context and spawn a sub agent per work item. You can read docs/phases/01_core_mvp.md for high level view

Make sure that agents have the relevant context (docs/architecture, docs/goals, docs/ux-design, their work item, gemini.md)

Work items should be sequential and work should be done on separate branches. We can do stacked prs.
